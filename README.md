# Maze-solver
Verilog algorithm that implements a synchronous sequential circuit that travels through a maze of 64Ã—64 size. Initially each point in the labyrinth can be described by states denoted by 0 and 1, respectively. The lane of the labyrinth is described by the points marked with 0, and the walls of the labyrinth are marked with 1. Each point traveled through the maze will be marked with 2, thus describing the route between the starting point and the exit from the labyrinth. The rule of going through the maze is given by the Wall Follower algorithm with the tracking of the right wall.
